Question 1
Suppose I conduct a study and publish my findings. Which of the following is an example of a replication of my study?
An investigator at another institution conducts a study addressing the same question, collects her own data, analyzes it separately from me, and publishes her own findings.

Question 2
Which of the following is a requirement for a published data analysis to be reproducible?
The full computer code for doing the data analysis is made publicly available.

Question 3
Which of the following is an example of a reproducible study?

Question 4
Which of the following is a reason that a study might NOT be fully replicated?
The original study was very expensive and there is no money to repeat it in a different setting.

Question 5
Which of the following is a reason why publishing reproducible research is increasingly important?
New technologies are increasing the rate of data collection, creating datasets that are more complex and extremely high dimensional.

Question 6
What is the role of processing code in the research pipeline?
It transforms the measured data into analytic data.

Question 7
Which is a goal of literate statistical programming?
Combine explanatory text and data analysis code in a single document.

Question 8
What does it mean to weave a literate statistical program?
Transform the literate program into a human readable document.

Question 9
Which of the following is required to implement a literate programming system?
A documentation language like LaTeX.

Question 10
What is one way in which the knitr system differs from Sweave?
knitr allows for the use of markdown instead of LaTeX.
